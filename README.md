stuff I use plus trying my hand at various old CS stuff like Red/Black trees or whatever.

I've got a bunch of Groovy I pretty much carry around and use when writing quick tools.
I'm tired of typing it or scping it or whatever.  If it's here with an open license then
I think my life will be easier.  Especially if I can get repo1.maven.org to carry it at
some point. TODO: something like that.

And then I thought: hey, why not bust out some of the old textbooks or whatever and give
that stuff a try?  I was looking at old class projects anyway (which I'm also going to
put up for giggles).  It's a bit of a break from consulting.  Sometimes.
